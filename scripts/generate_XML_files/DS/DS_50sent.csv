10587445-2	It reveals that (i) D1-D2-Cyt b(559) complexes either in solubilized form or incorporated into liposomes contain only one type of Cyt b(559) with E(m) values of 60 +/- 5 and 100 +/- 10 mV, respectively, at pH 6.8; (ii) in <compound-id="977">oxygen</compound-id>-evolving solubilized <protein-id="P49810,E5RG63">PS II</protein-id> core complexes Cyt b(559) exists predominantly (>85%) as an LP form with an E(m,7) of 125 +/- 10 mV and a minor fraction with an E(m,7) of -150 +/- 15 mV; (iii) in <compound-id="977">oxygen</compound-id>-evolving <protein-id="P49810,E5RG63">PS II</protein-id> membrane fragments three different redox forms are discernible with E(m) values of 390 +/- 15 mV (HP form), 230 +/- 20 mV (IP form), and 105 +/- 25 mV (LP form) and relative amplitudes of 58, 24, and 18%, respectively, at pH 7.3; (iv) the E(m) values are almost pH-independent between pH 6 and 9.5 in all sample types except D1-D2-Cyt b(559) complexes incorporated into liposomes with a slope of -29 mV/pH unit, when the pH increases from 6 to 9.5 (IP and LP form in <protein-id="P49810,E5RG63">PS II</protein-id> membrane fragments possibly within a restricted range from pH 6.5 to 8); (v) at pH >8 the HP Cyt b(559) progressively converts to the IP form with increasing pH; (vi) the reduced-minus-oxidized optical difference spectra of Cyt b(559) are very similar in the lambda range of 360-700 nm for all types except for the HP form which exhibits pronounced differences in the Soret band; and (vii) <protein-id="P49810,E5RG63">PS II</protein-id> membrane fragments and core complexes are inferred to contain about two Cyt b(559) hemes per <protein-id="P49810,E5RG63">PS II</protein-id>.	oxygen__PS II__no_interaction
